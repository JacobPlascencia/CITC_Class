                <li>"I am the bone of my sword
                    Steel is my body and fire is my blood
                    I have created over a thousand blades
                    Unknown to Death,
                    Nor known to Life.
                    Have withstood pain to create many weapons
                    Yet, those hands will never hold anything
                    So as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works." -Archer
